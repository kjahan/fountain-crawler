Fountain Crawler
================

General Description:
This project is a Python crawler for Flickr website. I developed this project in order to mine Flickr website and search for a text query such as "drinking fountains" to find all photos which have mentioned the text query as meta-dtaa and have geo-location. This idea is useful for crawling and indexing different hotspots in a city. Please check the following links for a few examples:

Fountain Crawler
================

General Description:
This project is a Python crawler for Flickr website. I developed this project in order to mine Flickr website and search for a text query such as "drinking fountains" to find all photos with geo-locations which have mentioned the text query as meta-data. This idea is useful for crawling/indexing different hotspots in a city which regular search engines like Google and Yahoo fail to index. Check the following links for two examples:
